   * tools/sjofn/sjofn.c (object::add_local): Fix to Sjofn
     to allow duplicate local symbols with identical values.


2001-10-21  Stanislav Karchebny  <berk@madfire.net>

   * Created ORB's internal console based on previous
     public console.asm implementation. It reduces overall size at
     the expense of some speed. If speed gain is needed - then link
     against the console.asm version.

   * tools/sjofn/sjofn.c: Minor fix to Sjofn to produce more
     reliable object names in xref file.


2001-10-07  Stanislav Karchebny  <berk@madfire.net>

   * Added doc/trees.txt about tree functions parameters.

   * Added ternary tree library to lib/tertree.

   * Added console__print_int to libos/console.asm.


2001-09-30  Stanislav Karchebny  <berk@madfire.net>

   * Added .cvsignore where necessary.

   * Added timing tests to lib/bintree.

   * Removed compilation re-enforcement from orb/makefile.
     (Now uses own dump.asm to prevent inconsistency)


2001-09-29  Stanislav Karchebny  <berk@madfire.net>

   * Added binary tree library to lib/bintree.

   * Minor fix to Sjofn - all data and text sections are
     now aligned.

   * Added --text-align= and --data-align= to Sjofn.

   * Fixed stupid typo in orb/makefile - was asking for libos.img
     instead of libos.bin (was somehow building however!).

   * Build fix to makefile - now builds libos from root makefile,
     not only orb/makefile.


2001-09-27  Stanislav Karchebny  <berk@madfire.net>

   * Added universal Generic Options Support module to tools/sjofn.


2001-09-22  Stanislav Karchebny  <berk@madfire.net>

   * Fixed IDLC for (formal) uint64 return value support.

   * Fixed IDLC for // and /* */ style comments support.


2001-09-21  Stanislav Karchebny  <berk@madfire.net>

   * Finished porting all ORB methods to assembly.


2001-09-18  Stanislav Karchebny  <berk@madfire.net>

   * Added version/build generation script by Chris Hansen.

   * Modified makefiles for more user settings (see top of root makefile).


2001-09-16  Stanislav Karchebny  <berk@madfire.net>

   * ORB constructor is finished. Now ORB successfully boots library OS.


2001-09-12  Stanislav Karchebny  <berk@madfire.net>

   * Minor fix to IDLC to allow \r\n line endings.

   * Sjofn linker is finished.


2001-08-25  Stanislav Karchebny  <berk@madfire.net>

   * Started a new Go! implementation circle. Now more practical.

   * Started this ChangeLog.  It would be nice if everybody
   can keep track of the changes this way.  Add changes
   to the top of the file.
