This is Illustrated Guide I'm writing to help you understand all internal functionality of
the Odin, purpose and operation of The ORB and operation of various components comprising
the whole operating system.<br>
This document is divided in chapters, each describing one separate thing in its entirety and
in interaction with other components. I will be writing chapters one by one, week by week, so
come back here to see if there's something new!<br>
