<H2> 4.1 OS image format </H2>
<!--docid::SEC11::-->
<P>

An OS image is generally just an ordinary 32-bit executable file in the
standard format for that particular operating system, except that it may
be linked at a non-default load address to avoid loading on top of the
PC's I/O region or other reserved areas, and of course it can't use
shared libraries or other fancy features.
</P><P>

Unfortunately, the exact meaning of the text, data, bss, and entry
fields of a.out headers tends to vary widely between different
executable flavors, and it is sometimes very difficult to distinguish
one flavor from another (e.g. Linux ZMAGIC executables and Mach
ZMAGIC executables). Furthermore, there is no simple, reliable way
of determining at what address in memory the text segment is supposed to
start. Therefore, this specification requires that an additional header,
known as a <EM>Multiboot header</EM>, appear somewhere near the beginning
of the executable file. In general it should come <EM>as early as
possible</EM>, and is typically embedded in the beginning of the text
segment after the <EM>real</EM> executable header. It <EM>must</EM> be
contained completely within the first 8192 bytes of the executable file,
and must be longword (32-bit) aligned. These rules allow the boot loader
to find and synchronize with the text segment in the a.out file without
knowing beforehand the details of the a.out variant. The layout of the
header is as follows:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>        +-------------------+
0       | magic: 0x1BADB002 |   (required)
4       | flags             |   (required)
8       | checksum          |   (required)
        +-------------------+
12      | header_addr       |   (present if flags[16] is set)
16      | load_addr         |   (present if flags[16] is set)
20      | load_end_addr     |   (present if flags[16] is set)
24      | bss_end_addr      |   (present if flags[16] is set)
28      | entry_addr        |   (present if flags[16] is set)
        +-------------------+
32      | mode_type         |   (present if flags[2] is set)
36      | width             |   (present if flags[2] is set)
40      | height            |   (present if flags[2] is set)
44      | depth             |   (present if flags[2] is set)
        +-------------------+
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

All fields are in little-endian byte order, of course. The first field
is the magic number identifying the header, which must be the hex value
0x1BADB002.
</P><P>

The <SAMP>`flags'</SAMP> field specifies features that the OS image requests or
requires of the boot loader. Bits 0-15 indicate requirements; if the
boot loader sees any of these bits set but doesn't understand the flag
or can't fulfill the requirements it indicates for some reason, it must
notify the user and fail to load the OS image. Bits 16-31 indicate
optional features; if any bits in this range are set but the boot loader
doesn't understand them, it can simply ignore them and proceed as
usual. Naturally, all as-yet-undefined bits in the <SAMP>`flags'</SAMP> word
must be set to zero in OS images. This way, the <SAMP>`flags'</SAMP> fields
serves for version control as well as simple feature selection.
</P><P>

If bit 0 in the <SAMP>`flags'</SAMP> word is set, then all boot modules loaded
along with the operating system must be aligned on page (4KB)
boundaries. Some operating systems expect to be able to map the pages
containing boot modules directly into a paged address space during
startup, and thus need the boot modules to be page-aligned.
</P><P>

If bit 1 in the <SAMP>`flags'</SAMP> word is set, then information on available
memory via at least the <SAMP>`mem_*'</SAMP> fields of the Multiboot information
structure (see section <A HREF="multiboot_4.html#SEC13">4.3 Boot information format</A>) must be included. If the
bootloader is capable of passing a memory map (the <SAMP>`mmap_*'</SAMP> fields)
and one exists, then it must be included as well.
</P><P>

If bit 2 in the <SAMP>`flags'</SAMP> word is set, information about the video
mode table, defined later, must be available to the kernel.
</P><P>

Also, information about a preferred default mode can be specified in the
<SAMP>`mode_type'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`width'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`height'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`depth'</SAMP>
fields. This is only a <EM>recommended</EM> mode by the kernel. If the
mode exists, the boot loader should set it if the user hasn't specified
a mode. If not, it should fall back to a similar mode, if available.
</P><P>

Valid numbers for <SAMP>`mode_type'</SAMP> is 0 for linear graphics mode and 1
for EGA-standard text mode. Everything else is reserved for future
expansion. Please note that even if you set this field to indicate that
you want a graphics mode, you might get a text mode.
</P><P>

<SAMP>`width'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`height'</SAMP> is specified in pixels, if graphics mode,
or characters in EGA text mode. <SAMP>`depth'</SAMP> is given in bits per pixel
for graphics, or zero for EGA text modes.
</P><P>

Any, some or all of those three fields may be set to zero, indicating to
the boot loader that no preference is given. This makes it possible for
a kernel to just say it wants a 32-bit resolution, for example.
</P><P>

If bit 16 in the <SAMP>`flags'</SAMP> word is set, then the fields at offsets
8-24 in the Multiboot header are valid, and the boot loader should use
them instead of the fields in the actual executable header to calculate
where to load the OS image. This information does not need to be
provided if the kernel image is in ELF format, but it <EM>must</EM>
be provided if the images is in a.out format or in some other
format. Compliant boot loaders must be able to load images that either
are in ELF format or contain the load address information embedded
in the Multiboot header; they may also directly support other executable
formats, such as particular a.out variants, but are not required to.
</P><P>

All of the address fields enabled by flag bit 16 are physical addresses.
The meaning of each is as follows:
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>header_addr</CODE>
<DD>Contains the address corresponding to the beginning of the Multiboot
header -- the physical memory location at which the magic value is
supposed to be loaded. This field serves to <EM>synchronize</EM> the
mapping between OS image offsets and physical memory addresses.
<P>

<DT><CODE>load_addr</CODE>
<DD>Contains the physical address of the beginning of the text segment. The
offset in the OS image file at which to start loading is defined by the
offset at which the header was found, minus (header_addr -
load_addr). load_addr must be less than or equal to header_addr.
<P>

<DT><CODE>load_end_addr</CODE>
<DD>Contains the physical address of the end of the data
segment. (load_end_addr - load_addr) specifies how much data to load.
This implies that the text and data segments must be consecutive in the
OS image; this is true for existing a.out executable formats.
<P>

<DT><CODE>bss_end_addr</CODE>
<DD>Contains the physical address of the end of the bss segment. The boot
loader initializes this area to zero, and reserves the memory it
occupies to avoid placing boot modules and other data relevant to the
operating system in that area.
<P>

<DT><CODE>entry_addr</CODE>
<DD>The physical address to which the boot loader should jump in order to
start running the operating system.
</DL>
<P>

The checksum is a 32-bit unsigned value which, when added to
the other required fields, must have a 32-bit unsigned sum of zero.

<H2> 4.2 Machine state </H2>
<!--docid::SEC12::-->
<P>

When the boot loader invokes the 32-bit operating system, the machine
must have the following state:
</P><P>

<UL>
<LI>
<CODE>CS</CODE> must be a 32-bit read/execute code segment with an offset of 0
and a limit of 0xFFFFFFFF.
<P>

<LI>
<CODE>DS</CODE>, <CODE>ES</CODE>, <CODE>FS</CODE>, <CODE>GS</CODE>, and <CODE>SS</CODE> must be a
32-bit read/write data segment with an offset of 0 and a limit of
0xFFFFFFFF.
<P>

<LI>
The address 20 line must be usable for standard linear 32-bit addressing
of memory (in standard PC hardware, it is wired to 0 at bootup,
forcing addresses in the 1-2 MB range to be mapped to the 0-1 MB range,
3-4 is mapped to 2-3, etc.).
<P>

<LI>
Paging must be turned off.
<P>

<LI>
The processor interrupt flag must be turned off.
<P>

<LI>
<CODE>EAX</CODE> must contain the magic value 0x2BADB002; the presence of this
value indicates to the operating system that it was loaded by a
Multiboot-compliant boot loader (e.g. as opposed to another type of boot
loader that the operating system can also be loaded from).
<P>

<LI>
<CODE>EBX</CODE> must contain the 32-bit physical address of the Multiboot
information structure provided by the boot loader (see section <A HREF="multiboot_4.html#SEC13">4.3 Boot information format</A>).
</UL>
<P>

All other processor registers and flag bits are undefined. This
includes, in particular:
</P><P>

<UL>
<LI>
<CODE>ESP</CODE>: the 32-bit operating system must create its own stack as
soon as it needs one.
<P>

<LI>
<CODE>GDTR</CODE>: Even though the segment registers are set up as described
above, the <CODE>GDTR</CODE> may be invalid, so the operating system must not
load any segment registers (even just reloading the same values!) until
it sets up its own <CODE>GDT</CODE>.
<P>

<LI>
<CODE>IDTR</CODE>: The operating system must leave interrupts disabled until
it sets up its own <CODE>IDT</CODE>.
</UL>
<P>

However, other machine state should be left by the boot loader in
<EM>normal working order</EM>, i.e. as initialized by the BIOS (or
DOS, if that's what the boot loader runs from). In other words, the
operating system should be able to make BIOS calls and such after
being loaded, as long as it does not overwrite the BIOS data
structures before doing so. Also, the boot loader must leave the
PIC programmed with the normal BIOS/DOS values, even if it
changed them during the switch to 32-bit mode.

<H2> 4.3 Boot information format </H2>
<!--docid::SEC13::-->
<P>

Upon entry to the operating system, the <CODE>EBX</CODE> register contains the
physical address of a <EM>Multiboot information</EM> data structure,
through which the boot loader communicates vital information to the
operating system. The operating system can use or ignore any parts of
the structure as it chooses; all information passed by the boot loader
is advisory only.
</P><P>

The Multiboot information structure and its related substructures may be
placed anywhere in memory by the boot loader (with the exception of the
memory reserved for the kernel and boot modules, of course). It is the
operating system's responsibility to avoid overwriting this memory until
it is done using it.
</P><P>

The format of the Multiboot information structure (as defined so far)
follows:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>        +-------------------+
0       | flags             |    (required)

        +-------------------+
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

The first longword indicates the presence and validity of other fields
in the Multiboot information structure. All as-yet-undefined bits must
be set to zero by the boot loader. Any set bits that the operating
system does not understand should be ignored. Thus, the <SAMP>`flags'</SAMP>
field also functions as a version indicator, allowing the Multiboot
information structure to be expanded in the future without breaking
anything.
</P><P>

If bit 0 in the <SAMP>`flags'</SAMP> word is set, then the <SAMP>`mem_*'</SAMP> fields
are valid. <SAMP>`mem_lower'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`mem_upper'</SAMP> indicate the amount of
lower and upper memory, respectively, in kilobytes. Lower memory starts
at address 0, and upper memory starts at address 1 megabyte. The maximum
possible value for lower memory is 640 kilobytes. The value returned for
upper memory is maximally the address of the first upper memory hole
minus 1 megabyte. It is not guaranteed to be this value.
</P><P>

If bit 1 in the <SAMP>`flags'</SAMP> word is set, then the <SAMP>`boot_device'</SAMP>
field is valid, and indicates which BIOS disk device the boot
loader loaded the OS image from. If the OS image was not loaded from a
BIOS disk, then this field must not be present (bit 3 must be
clear). The operating system may use this field as a hint for
determining its own <EM>root</EM> device, but is not required to. The
<SAMP>`boot_device'</SAMP> field is laid out in four one-byte subfields as
follows:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>+-------+-------+-------+-------+
| drive | part1 | part2 | part3 |
+-------+-------+-------+-------+
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

The first byte contains the BIOS drive number as understood by the
BIOS INT 0x13 low-level disk interface: e.g. 0x00 for the first
floppy disk or 0x80 for the first hard disk.
</P><P>

The three remaining bytes specify the boot partition. <SAMP>`part1'</SAMP>
specifies the <EM>top-level</EM> partition number, <SAMP>`part2'</SAMP> specifies a
<EM>sub-partition</EM> in the top-level partition, etc. Partition numbers
always start from zero. Unused partition bytes must be set to 0xFF. For
example, if the disk is partitioned using a simple one-level DOS
partitioning scheme, then <SAMP>`part1'</SAMP> contains the DOS partition
number, and <SAMP>`part2'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`part3'</SAMP> are both 0xFF. As another
example, if a disk is partitioned first into DOS partitions, and then
one of those DOS partitions is subdivided into several BSD partitions
using BSD's <EM>disklabel</EM> strategy, then <SAMP>`part1'</SAMP> contains the DOS
partition number, <SAMP>`part2'</SAMP> contains the BSD sub-partition within
that DOS partition, and <SAMP>`part3'</SAMP> is 0xFF.
</P><P>

DOS extended partitions are indicated as partition numbers starting from
4 and increasing, rather than as nested sub-partitions, even though the
underlying disk layout of extended partitions is hierarchical in
nature. For example, if the boot loader boots from the second extended
partition on a disk partitioned in conventional DOS style, then
<SAMP>`part1'</SAMP> will be 5, and <SAMP>`part2'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`part3'</SAMP> will both be
0xFF.
</P><P>

If bit 2 of the <SAMP>`flags'</SAMP> longword is set, the <SAMP>`cmdline'</SAMP> field
is valid, and contains the physical address of the command line to
be passed to the kernel. The command line is a normal C-style
zero-terminated string.
</P><P>

If bit 3 of the <SAMP>`flags'</SAMP> is set, then the <SAMP>`mods'</SAMP> fields
indicate to the kernel what boot modules were loaded along with the
kernel image, and where they can be found. <SAMP>`mods_count'</SAMP> contains
the number of modules loaded; <SAMP>`mods_addr'</SAMP> contains the physical
address of the first module structure. <SAMP>`mods_count'</SAMP> may be zero,
indicating no boot modules were loaded, even if bit 1 of <SAMP>`flags'</SAMP> is
set. Each module structure is formatted as follows:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>        +-------------------+
0       | mod_start         |
4       | mod_end           |
        +-------------------+
8       | string            |
        +-------------------+
12      | reserved (0)      |
        +-------------------+
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

The first two fields contain the start and end addresses of the boot
module itself. The <SAMP>`string'</SAMP> field provides an arbitrary string to
be associated with that particular boot module; it is a zero-terminated
ASCII string, just like the kernel command line. The <SAMP>`string'</SAMP> field
may be 0 if there is no string associated with the module. Typically the
string might be a command line (e.g. if the operating system treats boot
modules as executable programs), or a pathname (e.g. if the operating
system treats boot modules as files in a file system), but its exact use
is specific to the operating system. The <SAMP>`reserved'</SAMP> field must be
set to 0 by the boot loader and ignored by the operating system.

<STRONG>Caution:</STRONG> Bits 4 &#38; 5 are mutually exclusive.
</P><P>

If bit 4 in the <SAMP>`flags'</SAMP> word is set, then the following fields in
the Multiboot information structure starting at byte 28 are valid:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>        +-------------------+

These indicate where the symbol table from an a.out kernel image can be
found. <SAMP>`addr'</SAMP> is the physical address of the size (4-byte unsigned
long) of an array of a.out format <EM>nlist</EM> structures, followed
immediately by the array itself, then the size (4-byte unsigned long) of
a set of zero-terminated ASCII strings (plus sizeof(unsigned long) in
this case), and finally the set of strings itself. <SAMP>`tabsize'</SAMP> is
equal to its size parameter (found at the beginning of the symbol
section), and <SAMP>`strsize'</SAMP> is equal to its size parameter (found at
the beginning of the string section) of the following string table to
which the symbol table refers. Note that <SAMP>`tabsize'</SAMP> may be 0,
indicating no symbols, even if bit 4 in the <SAMP>`flags'</SAMP> word is set.
</P><P>

If bit 5 in the <SAMP>`flags'</SAMP> word is set, then the following fields in
the Multiboot information structure starting at byte 28 are valid:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>        +-------------------+

</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

These indicate where the section header table from an ELF kernel is, the
size of each entry, number of entries, and the string table used as the
index of names. They correspond to the <SAMP>`shdr_*'</SAMP> entries
(<SAMP>`shdr_num'</SAMP>, etc.) in the Executable and Linkable Format (ELF)
specification in the program header. All sections are loaded, and the
physical address fields of the ELF section header then refer to where
the sections are in memory (refer to the i386 ELF documentation for
details as to how to read the section header(s)). Note that
<SAMP>`shdr_num'</SAMP> may be 0, indicating no symbols, even if bit 5 in the
<SAMP>`flags'</SAMP> word is set.
</P><P>

If bit 6 in the <SAMP>`flags'</SAMP> word is set, then the <SAMP>`mmap_*'</SAMP> fields
are valid, and indicate the address and length of a buffer containing a
memory map of the machine provided by the BIOS. <SAMP>`mmap_addr'</SAMP> is
the address, and <SAMP>`mmap_length'</SAMP> is the total size of the buffer. The
buffer consists of one or more of the following size/structure pairs
(<SAMP>`size'</SAMP> is really used for skipping to the next pair):
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>        +-------------------+

where <SAMP>`size'</SAMP> is the size of the associated structure in bytes, which
can be greater than the minimum of 20 bytes. <SAMP>`base_addr_low'</SAMP> is the
lower 32 bits of the starting address, and <SAMP>`base_addr_high'</SAMP> is the
upper 32 bits, for a total of a 64-bit starting address. <SAMP>`length_low'</SAMP>
is the lower 32 bits of the size of the memory region in bytes, and
<SAMP>`length_high'</SAMP> is the upper 32 bits, for a total of a 64-bit
length. <SAMP>`type'</SAMP> is the variety of address range represented, where a
value of 1 indicates available RAM, and all other values currently
indicated a reserved area.
</P><P>

The map provided is guaranteed to list all standard RAM that should
be available for normal use.
</P><P>

If bit 7 in the <SAMP>`flags'</SAMP> is set, then the <SAMP>`drives_*'</SAMP> fields
are valid, and indicate the address of the physical address of the first
drive structure and the number of drive structures. <SAMP>`drives_addr'</SAMP>
is the address, and <SAMP>`drives_count'</SAMP> is the
number. <SAMP>`drives_count'</SAMP> may be zero. Each drive structure is
formatted as follows:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>        +-------------------+
0       | drive_number      |
        +-------------------+

        +-------------------+
</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

The <SAMP>`drive_number'</SAMP> field contains the BIOS drive number. The
<SAMP>`drive_mode'</SAMP> field represents the access mode used by the boot
loader. Currently, the following modes are defined:
</P><P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><SAMP>`0'</SAMP>
<DD>CHS mode (traditional cylinder/head/sector addressing mode).
<P>

<DT><SAMP>`1'</SAMP>
<DD>LBA mode (Logical Block Addressing mode).
</DL>
<P>

The three fields, <SAMP>`drive_cylinders'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`drive_heads'</SAMP> and
<SAMP>`drive_sectors'</SAMP>, indicate the geometry of the drive detected by the
BIOS. <SAMP>`drive_cylinders'</SAMP> contains the number of the
cylinders. <SAMP>`drive_heads'</SAMP> contains the number of the
heads. <SAMP>`drive_sectors'</SAMP> contains the number of the sectors per
track.
</P><P>

The <SAMP>`drive_ports'</SAMP> field contains the physical address of the array
of the I/O ports used for the drive in the BIOS code. The array
consists of zero or more unsigned two-bytes integers, and is terminated
with zero. Note that the array may contain any number of I/O ports that
are not related to the drive actually (such as DMA controller's
ports).
</P><P>

The last field <SAMP>`reserved'</SAMP> is reserved for future use, and must be
zero. The size is four bytes.
</P><P>

If bit 8 in the <SAMP>`flags'</SAMP> is set, then the <SAMP>`config_table'</SAMP> field
is valid, and indicates the address of the ROM configuration table
returned by the <EM>GET CONFIGURATION</EM> BIOS call. If the BIOS
call fails, then the size of the table must be <EM>zero</EM>.
</P><P>

If bit 9 in the <SAMP>`flags'</SAMP> is set, the <SAMP>`boot_loader_name'</SAMP> field
is valid, and contains the physical address of the name of the boot
loader booting the kernel. The name is a normal C-style zero-terminated
string.
</P><P>

If bit 11 in the <SAMP>`flags'</SAMP> is set, video mode information is
available in the mode table. This should only be done if the kernel has
indicated in the <SAMP>`Multiboot Header'</SAMP> that it accepts graphics modes.
</P><P>

The mode table looks like this:
</P><P>

<TABLE><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td class=example><pre>
        +----------------------+
0       | mode_type            |

8       | height               |
12      | depth                |
16      | frame_buffer_address |
        +----------------------+

</pre></td></tr></table></P><P>

Valid numbers for <SAMP>`mode_type'</SAMP> is 0 for linear graphics mode and 1
for EGA-standard text mode. Everything else is reserved for future
expansion.
</P><P>

<SAMP>`width'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`height'</SAMP> is specified in pixels, if graphics mode,
or characters in EGA text mode. <SAMP>`depth'</SAMP> is given in bits per pixel
for graphics, or unused for EGA text mode.
</P><P>

<SAMP>`frame_buffer_address'</SAMP> specifies the physical start address of the
linear frame buffer. This is valid for both graphics and text modes.
