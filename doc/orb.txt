Defines that affect ORB behavior:

__DEBUG            Makes a debug build with alot of extra checks made, recommended during
                   development. I also suggest moving some of the _DEBUG branch features
                   into release versions as well.

__VERBOSE_STARTUP  Makes boot up process rather verbose. ORB prints various information
                   about steps taken, components installed etc.. Very useful if you want
                   to know a little about ORB internals, impress your linuxoid friend or
                   find some nasty bug in the code. All supplement macros for such behavior
                   are included in file debug.inc and are recommended for use by developers.

__NO_CONSOLE_COMP  Disables internal ORB console component.


Support for big (over 64K) stacks is decided to be primary. The support for small
stacks have been refused and removed from source. The current support for big stacks is,
however, partial because it doesn't grok page-gran stacks. Subject to FIXME.
(However, in its current state stacks of up to 1Meg size are supported - should be pretty
enough for most applications. If you encounter a problem with that (i.e. your program
wants more stack space), submit a support request on our bug tracker).
