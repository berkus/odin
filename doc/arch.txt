Possible Architecture Independence in Future Versions of Odin.

Taking an approach from Flex Mach 4 distribution, the machine-dependent code is
"master" (primary) and machine-independent code is "slave". So, when there is a more
specific piece of code for needed arch, we use exactly that piece. If there's only
independent one, we can use it or write a dependent one of our own =).

Following the Mach4 convention, arch packages should be split into two parts:
- part 1: the "slave", machine-independent package. Should be installed to support all
  functionality that don't present in more specific packages.
- part 2: the "master", machine-dependent part for target platform.

There is also a possibility to make third package especially for some specific vendor or
platform, e.g. for Sequent Symmetry or HP/Convex Exemplar. It will most probably be based
on the two part 1 and 2 packages but will add some more value.

TODO:
- Research reasonability for such split-ups in spite of completely component-based design
(i.e. unlike Mach/Linux we're not solid-kernel but have a lot of components, that might
and sure will be independent from each other's implementation, therefore needing alot of packages
for different archs if we take an approach... however, this might increase their efficiency decently).
