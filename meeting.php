We plan to have weekly or so meetings on IRC on
server irc.openprojects.net on channel #odin.<br>
Due to different time constraints you can post your spare
time span in GMT time and day of week to our
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=416678&group_id=36293&func=browse" target="_blank">Meeting tracker</a>.
I will collect and intersect all times with my best effort possible and schedule the next meeting.
Scheduled meeting times will be available on this page in section "next scheduled meeting" and also
available in closing event I will send in response to all Meeting tracker requests.<br>
